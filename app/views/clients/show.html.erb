<h1> <%= @client.name %></h1>

<p>I am guessing that on this page you will see a list of the items you need to complete for this </p>


<p>Here you can see a list of clients sites that you have access to and/or you can add a new site.</p>
		<ul>
				<% @client.client_sites.each do |client_site| %>
					<li><%= link_to client_site.name, client_client_site_path(@client, client_site) %></li>
				<% end %>
			</ul>

<%= link_to "Add a Client's Site", new_client_client_site_path(@client) %>
