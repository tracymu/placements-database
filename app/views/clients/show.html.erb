<h1> This is the Client Show Page</h1>

<p>I am guessing that on this page you will see a list of the items you need to complete for this </p>

<p>I guess on this page you might also be able to 'add a target site'</p>

<h3>Now I want to add a client website</h3>


<%= link_to "Add a Client's Site", new_client_client_site_path(@client) %>
