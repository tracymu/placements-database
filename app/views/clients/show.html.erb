<h1> This is the Client Show Page</h1>

<p>I am guessing that on this page you will see a list of the items you need to complete for this </p>

<p>I guess on this page you might also be able to 'add a target site'</p>

<p>Here you can see a list of clients sites that you have access to and/or you can add a new site.</p>


	<% @client.client_sites.each do |client_site| %>
					<li><%= link_to client_site.name, client_site_path %> </li>
				<% end %>

<%= link_to "Add a Client's Site", new_client_client_site_path(@client) %>
